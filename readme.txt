Build, manage, preview, send, and track complex transactional email templates from WordPress.

== Description ==

Well-Handled lets developers build, manage, preview, send, and track complex transactional email templates with WordPress, freeing them from the time and expense of using a third-party service like Mandrill.  It comes with a ton of template processing options, easy drop-in functions for generating and sending transactional emails, and hookable filters for developers with additional needs.

  * Manage and preview email templates through WP-Admin;
  * Color-coded editor with dozens of themes;
  * Support for Handlebar/Mustache markup;
  * Preview templates in WP-Admin or send as an email;
  * Numerous post-processing options such as CSS inlining, comment removal, whitespace compression, etc., let you keep your working code readable and the rendered product optimal;
  * Shortcode and fragment support (like reusable headers, etc.);
  * Pro: send emails via SMTP, Amazon SES, or Mandrill;
  * Pro: track open rates and clicks, search send history, view statistics, access full message details;
  * Pro: assign template and statistic access on a per-role basis;
  * Pro: mail sending via queue instead of realtime

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive and upload the entire `well-handled` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Done!

== Requirements ==

Well-Handled is more complex than the average plugin and therefore requires a litlte more from your server:

 * WordPress 4.7 or later.
 * PHP 5.6 or later.
 * PHP extensions: date, dom, filter, hash, imap, json, libxml, openssl, pcre
 * UTF-8 encoding.
 * Well-Handled is *not* compatible with WordPress Multi-Site.

Please note: it is **not safe** to run WordPress atop a version of PHP that has reached its [End of Life](http://php.net/supported-versions.php). As of right now, that means your server should only be running **PHP 5.6 or newer**.

Future releases of this plugin might, out of necessity, drop support for old, unmaintained versions of PHP. To ensure you continue to receive plugin updates, bug fixes, and new features, just make sure PHP is kept up-to-date. :)
